## Ideas
- Create a checklist of sheets typically found in each phase of design
- Home page with list of active and closed projects
- Click on project and it has a project status section showing if you're currently in SD, DD, CD, or permit, Pre plat, license agreements etc.
  - Also can break down this info for each phase if the project has multiple phases
-  A section for meeting notes
-  A section for schedule (different than deadlines as this can be shown more like a gantt chart)
-  A section for deadlines
-  A way to send/receive task requests to/from other team members
  - once received it goes into a new area called "my tasks"
-
